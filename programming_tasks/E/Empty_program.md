# [Empty program][1]

The empty program is valid and does nothing but return a successful exit code.



It is also possible to just specify that the program is written in Perl6:

```text
use v6;
```


or, for relax mode (not yet implemented in rakudo, though):

```text
v6;
```


or even:

```text
6;
```
